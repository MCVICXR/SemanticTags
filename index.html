			<p>When I was little, I was lucky to have an old Power Mac in the house much like the one pictured above. I spent a lot of time just clicking around around and exploring the programs that were installed on it.</p>
			<p>However, for a very long time I was under the impression that most, if not all, computer coding was just a bunch of ones and zeros. I was wrong, but I didn't really know it until I was almost out of college.</p>
			<p>When I into delved into HTML and CSS, I had no idea how other skills I had developed would assist me in building a website. My writing and language skills helped me quickly undertsand the concepts of syntax and semantics that are involved with HTML, and my design and layout skills greatly assisted me in working with CSS. <a href="http://www.mcvicxr.net" target="blank"> Here's the website that I built for myself a while back.</a> It's a little silly, and I haven't had much time to update it recently. I hope that I can improve it with what I learn in this clas.</p>
